## About

This module is similar to [ProcessPageListMultipleSorting](https://processwire.com/modules/process-page-list-multiple-sorting/) by [David Karich](https://processwire.com/modules/author/david-karich/) but is closer to what could be in the core as it adds the custom sort setting in both the template’s “Family” tab and in the page’s “Children” tab (when applicable).

Once a custom sort is set, it gets applied in the page list but also when doing PW’s API calls like `$page->children()`.
